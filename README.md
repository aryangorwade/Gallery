# Gallery
This program opens a control window. Images and their size (in pixels) can be set using the drop down image, the text fields, and the set size button. The images open in new windows and can be changed. By default, poster 1 opens when the program is run.
To run the program, go to A5 / src / edu / foothill / Gallery.java: The main method is in there. Don't run the ImageDisplay.java's main method.
